            <section class="intro">
                <p>My name is Jonathan S치nchez, a 24-year-old with a solid background in multiplatform application development, recently graduated from a higher degree in this field. I am passionate about the world of technology and eager to start my professional career in this exciting sector.</p>
                <p>During my academic training, I have had the opportunity to acquire competencies in various programming languages, interface design, and application development for different platforms. I am excited to apply this knowledge in work environments and contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can make a difference in people's lives.</p>
                <p>My work experience covers a variety of sectors, but I highlight my two years at Mercadona, where I had the opportunity to develop skills in customer service, team management, and problem-solving in a dynamic and challenging environment. Furthermore, my experience as a tour guide and bus monitor at Chapin for 4 and a half years allowed me to refine my communication, adaptability, and leadership skills, as well as learn to work effectively in teams to ensure a satisfactory experience for customers.</p>
                <p>It is important to mention that I have a C1 level of English, which allows me to work in that language without difficulty, thus expanding my possibilities to contribute effectively in international environments.</p>
